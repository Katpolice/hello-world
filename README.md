# hello-world
The beginning of a coding adventure. It contains a journal of my progress. 
My name is Katpolice (Gilbert) and I'm offically starting my grind on becoming a developer today. 
I do have some past experience with programming like Scratch, Ev3 basic, RobotC and a bit of Python.
However, beyond that exposure and trial and error from years of experience with Robotics, I havn't formally taken any programming classes/courses. So as of today (July/2/19) I will begin my formal coding jounery with websites like Github, EdX, LeetCode, Khan Academy and Lynda.
Thank you for listening to my Ted talk.

July/3/19 - 
I started working on the Community starter kit which is offered by The GitHub Training Team. I completed the first course step "Add a repository description". However, it seems like I messed up with the "EDIT the README" section and I'm trying to troubleshoot it. By the looks of it, it seems like I accidently messed up one of the steps and which off track. Resulting in a unfixable loop that I can't seem to fix and/or undo. Therefore it seems like I have to restart the whole Community starter kit. Currently on Lynda, I'm watching a playlist called "Programming Foundations: Fundamentals" inorder to get a strong foundation in programming. So far I learned about "machine languages" and appearly C+ is closer to it then somelike like Python. 
In other news, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram are having troubles with sending photos to other users on there platform. All 3 companies are owned by Facebook. Likewise, Twitter is having troubles with there private message system. I suspect a DDoS by some company or organization because it's literally the day before July 4th. Or it could be some shady plot to extract specific images and/or private messages from certain individuals/groups. Honestly, who knows at this point until there's a formal news conference.

July/4/19 - 
Well it's offical. I broke the Community starter kit by the looks of it, I could restart the whole process which I'm considering. However it seems like I was a little bit ambiguous so I started working on "Reviewing pull requests" by The GitHub Training Team. I completed all 8 steps and I learned about pull requests and all of the possibilities and neat features about them. The biggest takeaway would be effective communicating about a change. For example, "This looks like it’ll be helpful to our users, but I’m not sure about the flow. I also have some concerns about the efficiency of these queries." or "Although this feature might be useful, do we have any data that identifies that our users need it?" both are which were directly taken from the "Reviewing pull requests" program. Although, I had a minor problem when I accidently progressed a few steps ahead. But, I managed to fix that by going back and working on those prior steps. It gave a bigger insight on what could have went wrong with my Community starter kit. It's possible that I committted the pull request with the master so that I was unable to work on any of the steps in between #2 and the final product. I will look into this further tomorrow. I downloaded Atom eariler today so I could start typing out and messing around with code. Appearly, there's a fit with the "best text editor" and I think it ultimately depends on your own preferneces. Currently on EdX, I decided to resume my progress on Python Basics for Data Science by IBM. I honestly forgot about it, until today. Currently on Khan Academy, I started watching 1 Organic Chemistry video a day starting from about 2 weeks ago. But recently I got interested in the Computer Science section instead. Currently on Lynda, I finished my first chapter and it was on "Programming Basics". I eager to learn about the next chapter which is about "Core Programming Syntax". In other news, there was a 6.4 magnitude earthquake west of Las Vegas and north of Los Angeles. I hope that everyone that was affected is safe. Random fact of the day: Enric Marco, a Catalan mechanic, was a prominent public face of Spanish survivors of the Holocaust for decades, until his story was revealed to be a lie.

July/5/19 - Today I found out that you can create your own website on Github. I sucessfully created a website and I'm planning to transfer my journal entries as blog posts on my website in the near future. In the mean time, I also played around with Wix and Wordpress and found out that GitHub and WordPress would be my go to. I actually found out about the whole concept of hosting from Github from the learning labs. I downloaded atom-beautify and oh boy my code does look colorful and codelike. So, I started to do some html and I honestly forgot what did what. I did learn a little bit of html before forgetting about it. So, I tried a format that I got from the web and I didn't like it. So, i chose to write my own code from scratch. I learned about subpages thank to StackOverflow and boy the amount of help/coding advice on that site is on par with Github. (And Google) Currently on Lynda, I learned about why JavaScript is so important, how to create your first program in JavaScript and requesting inputs. Currently on Khan Academy, I learned about how it's possible to generate "English looking" text using Markov chains. In other words, English is filled with randoness and statistics. Also, this Markov theory can be used to explain "communication." Currently on EdX, I learned about sets and how you can visually represent them with a Venn diagram. In other news, Appearly Nathan Phillips Square can fit about 100,000 people during the Raptor's parade. Also, a one stop subway extentison cost 4 billions for poltical and zoning reasons. So, that's interesting and the back and forth debate about the general area Scarborough about a "subway extension" for at least 30+ years? Honestly, that's an oof. Random fact of the day: In 4 of the 5 largest cities in the U.S., it's cheaper to rely on Uber than to own a car, a 2018 report found.
