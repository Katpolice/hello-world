# hello-world
The beginning of a coding adventure. It contains a journal of my progress. 
My name is Katpolice (Gilbert) and I'm offically starting my grind on becoming a developer today. 
I do have some past experience with programming like Scratch, Ev3 basic, RobotC and a bit of Python.
However, beyond that exposure and trial and error from years of experience with Robotics, I havn't formally taken any programming classes/courses. So as of today (July/2/19) I will begin my formal coding jounery with websites like Github, EdX, LeetCode, Khan Academy and Lynda.
Thank you for listening to my Ted talk.

July/3/19 - 
I started working on the Community starter kit which is offered by The GitHub Training Team. I completed the first course step "Add a repository description". However, it seems like I messed up with the "EDIT the README" section and I'm trying to troubleshoot it. By the looks of it, it seems like I accidently messed up one of the steps and which off track. Resulting in a unfixable loop that I can't seem to fix and/or undo. Therefore it seems like I have to restart the whole Community starter kit. Currently on Lynda, I'm watching a playlist called "Programming Foundations: Fundamentals" inorder to get a strong foundation in programming. So far I learned about "machine languages" and appearly C+ is closer to it then somelike like Python. 
In other news, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram are having troubles with sending photos to other users on there platform. All 3 companies are owned by Facebook. Likewise, Twitter is having troubles with there private message system. I suspect a DDoS by some company or organization because it's literally the day before July 4th. Or it could be some shady plot to extract specific images and/or private messages from certain individuals/groups. Honestly, who knows at this point until there's a formal news conference.

Well it's offical. I broke the Community starter kit by the looks of it, I could restart the whole process which I'm considering. However it seems like I was a little bit ambiguous so I started working on "Reviewing pull requests" by The GitHub Training Team. I completed all 8 steps and I learned about pull requests and all of the possibilities and neat features about them. The biggest takeaway would be effective communicating about a change. For example, "This looks like it’ll be helpful to our users, but I’m not sure about the flow. I also have some concerns about the efficiency of these queries." or "Although this feature might be useful, do we have any data that identifies that our users need it?" both are which were directly taken from the "Reviewing pull requests" program. Although, I had a minor problem when I accidently progressed a few steps ahead. But, I managed to fix that by going back and working on those prior steps. It gave a bigger insight on what could have went wrong with my Community starter kit. It's possible that I committted the pull request with the master so that I was unable to work on any of the steps in between #2 and the final product. I will look into this further tomorrow. I downloaded Atom eariler today so I could start typing out and messing around with code. Appearly, there's a fit with the "best text editor" and I think it ultimately depends on your own preferneces. Currently on EdX, I decided to resume my progress on Python Basics for Data Science by IBM. I honestly forgot about it, until today. Currently on Khan Academy, I started watching 1 Organic Chemistry video a day starting from about 2 weeks ago. But recently I got interested in the Computer Science section instead. Currently on Lynda, I finished my first chapter and it was on "Programming Basics". I eager to learn about the next chapter which is about "Core Programming Syntax". In other news, there was a 6.4 magnitude earthquake west of Las Vegas and north of Los Angeles. I hope that everyone that was affected is safe. Random fact of the day: Enric Marco, a Catalan mechanic, was a prominent public face of Spanish survivors of the Holocaust for decades, until his story was revealed to be a lie.
