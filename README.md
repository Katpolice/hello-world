# hello-world
The beginning of a coding adventure. It contains a journal of my progress. 
My name is Katpolice (Gilbert) and I'm offically starting my grind on becoming a developer today. 
I do have some past experience with programming like Scratch, Ev3 basic, RobotC and a bit of Python.
However, beyond that exposure and trial and error from years of experience with Robotics, I havn't formally taken any programming classes/courses. So as of today (July/2/19) I will begin my formal coding jounery with websites like Github, EdX, LeetCode, Khan Academy and Coursea. I have used resources like Lynda in the past. 
Thank you for listening to my Ted talk. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

July/3/19 - 
I started working on the Community starter kit which is offered by The GitHub Training Team. I completed the first course step "Add a repository description". However, it seems like I messed up with the "EDIT the README" section and I'm trying to troubleshoot it. By the looks of it, it seems like I accidently messed up one of the steps and which off track. Resulting in a unfixable loop that I can't seem to fix and/or undo. Therefore it seems like I have to restart the whole Community starter kit. Currently on Lynda, I'm watching a playlist called "Programming Foundations: Fundamentals" inorder to get a strong foundation in programming. So far I learned about "machine languages" and appearly C+ is closer to it then somelike like Python. 
In other news, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram are having troubles with sending photos to other users on there platform. All 3 companies are owned by Facebook. Likewise, Twitter is having troubles with there private message system. I suspect a DDoS by some company or organization because it's literally the day before July 4th. Or it could be some shady plot to extract specific images and/or private messages from certain individuals/groups. Honestly, who knows at this point until there's a formal news conference. 
That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

July/4/19 - 
Well it's offical. I broke the Community starter kit by the looks of it, I could restart the whole process which I'm considering. However it seems like I was a little bit ambiguous so I started working on "Reviewing pull requests" by The GitHub Training Team. I completed all 8 steps and I learned about pull requests and all of the possibilities and neat features about them. The biggest takeaway would be effective communicating about a change. For example, "This looks like it’ll be helpful to our users, but I’m not sure about the flow. I also have some concerns about the efficiency of these queries." or "Although this feature might be useful, do we have any data that identifies that our users need it?" both are which were directly taken from the "Reviewing pull requests" program. Although, I had a minor problem when I accidently progressed a few steps ahead. But, I managed to fix that by going back and working on those prior steps. It gave a bigger insight on what could have went wrong with my Community starter kit. It's possible that I committted the pull request with the master so that I was unable to work on any of the steps in between #2 and the final product. I will look into this further tomorrow. I downloaded Atom eariler today so I could start typing out and messing around with code. Appearly, there's a fit with the "best text editor" and I think it ultimately depends on your own preferneces. Currently on EdX, I decided to resume my progress on Python Basics for Data Science by IBM. I honestly forgot about it, until today. Currently on Khan Academy, I started watching 1 Organic Chemistry video a day starting from about 2 weeks ago. But recently I got interested in the Computer Science section instead. Currently on Lynda, I finished my first chapter and it was on "Programming Basics". I eager to learn about the next chapter which is about "Core Programming Syntax". In other news, there was a 6.4 magnitude earthquake west of Las Vegas and north of Los Angeles. I hope that everyone that was affected is safe.

July/5/19 - Today I found out that you can create your own website on Github. I sucessfully created a website and I'm planning to transfer my journal entries as blog posts on my website in the near future. In the mean time, I also played around with Wix and Wordpress and found out that GitHub and WordPress would be my go to. I actually found out about the whole concept of hosting from Github from the learning labs. I downloaded atom-beautify and oh boy my code does look colorful and codelike. So, I started to do some html and I honestly forgot what did what. I did learn a little bit of html before forgetting about it. So, I tried a format that I got from the web and I didn't like it. So, i chose to write my own code from scratch. I learned about subpages thank to StackOverflow and boy the amount of help/coding advice on that site is on par with Github. (And Google) Currently on Lynda, I learned about why JavaScript is so important, how to create your first program in JavaScript and requesting inputs. Currently on Khan Academy, I learned about how it's possible to generate "English looking" text using Markov chains. In other words, English is filled with randoness and statistics. Also, this Markov theory can be used to explain "communication." Currently on EdX, I learned about sets and how you can visually represent them with a Venn diagram. In other news, Appearly Nathan Phillips Square can fit about 100,000 people during the Raptor's parade. Also, a one stop subway extentison cost 4 billions for poltical and zoning reasons. So, that's interesting and the back and forth debate about the general area Scarborough about a "subway extension" for at least 30+ years? Honestly, that's an oof. That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

July/6-9/19 - I did manage to do a little bit of programming on each of the day, but I didn't do enough to prompt a daily add-on for each date due to other commitments. Also, I switched from Atom to Visual Studio Code because it's "meta". Currently on Lynda, I learned about variables and data types. I got an introduciton to variables and data types, how to use duck-typed languages, the ins and outs with numbers, characters and strings, working with operators, properly using white space and adding comments to code for human understanding. Likewise, I learned about writing conditional code. In terms of using if statements, complex conditions, comparison operator and switch statements. Currently on Khan Academy, I learned more about computer science and algorithms. Currently on edx, I did some lab questions about sets. In other news, Bombardier are cutting half of there staff (550 of 1100) at their Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada plant. Which is kind of odd because they still own the TTC well overdued streetcars. That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

July/10/19 - I got some sores which are mainly from not taking enough breaks inbetween coding, I'll keep that in mind for the future. Currently in Lynda, I learned about modular code. Topics like why you should be breaking your code apart, how to create and call functions, setting parameters and agruments, understanding variable scope and splitiing ocde into different files. Currently on Khan Academy, I learned more about computer science and digged even deeper in algorithms. Currently on edx, I learned about how to create and use dictionaries in python. In other news, the classic political blame game is happening in regards to the layoffs with Bombardier. I don't like the outcome of this. That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

July/11-16/19 - Well these sores translated into infections and let's just say that wasn't fun at all. Anyways, I'm currently getting better to the point where I can actually sit for once. Currently on Khan Academy, I somewhat managed a computer science video everyday. Currently for edx and Lynda, I wasn't able to watch and learn, let alone program for the duration of time sadly. In other news, Ikea is closing down it's only US production site and moving it to Europe. That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

April/3/20 - Well alot of things happened since my last update. A three week long summer vacation, summer job making bubble tea, qualifying for vex provinicals and senior year of high school. Also, a few bad things like a concussion, COVID-19 and school being closed indefinite. Regardless, I'm going to champion the way and get back to my coding adventures. OHhyeah, I got a free 12 year old laptop so that's neat. Sadly, I can't install Microsoft Visual Studio on it but Notepad++ will do. My resource of choose right now is University of Watrloo OpenCS because honestly I need a structured to help me get back into the groove. That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

April/4/20 - Today I learned Python with a course called Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming which I got for free on Udemy. I reviewed the basics and got right into flow control. (Eg. charts, if, else, elif statements, while/for loops) It was very interesting. That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

April/5/20 - Today I learned about how to use and create functions in a global and local environment. Likewise, with handling errors with try/except statements. That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

May/22-28/20 - I have decided to mess around with Minecraft's Nether Update beta on bedrock and I found some interesting bugs being a floating and sinking wither.

Floating wither (https://youtu.be/OPqhnoF-nJk) - I spawned 5 withers at the same time and one acted normally while the other 4 just floated upwards endlessly. I suspect that it has something to do with the spawn damage created when a (or 5) withers are spawned. 

Sinking wither (https://youtu.be/lqHZ9PnIfJc\) - I spawned a wither in the end and I was stuck with it in the end platform being underground end stone. So, I tapped the wither forcing it to show a explosion until it broke free at the edge of the island. It moved around for a bit before sinking to the void and later dying. I think it has something to do with the wither not having something to attack in sight causing it to gitch and sink.

May/28/20 - Today I learned about try and except statements, creating a "Guess the Number" program, Lists and using loops with lists, multiple assignments and augmented operators. I'm also 25% completed of the course on Udemy so thats neat. That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

May/29/20 - Today I learned about list methods and similarities between lists and stirngs. My favorites being variable.sort(key-str.lower), the ASCIIbetical order and variable.deepcopy() That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

May/30/20 - Today I learned about Dictionaries, data types and data strutures. I have also created a program that displays the number of each characters of what you paste. Likewise, it displays it with pprint.pprint (pretty print) as in a horziontal and more readable format rather than one really long string. That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off. 

May/31/20 - Today I learned about more about strings in particular about advanced string syntax, string methods and string formatting. Such as...

\n for creating more readable code with the print() function
variable.upper() to change the variable is in all caps
variable.lower() to change the variable is in all lowercase
variable.iupper() to check if the variable is in uppercase
variable.islower() to check if the variable is in lowercase
and others like .alpha(), .alnum(), .isdecimal(), isspace() & .istitle() which check if it contained said object in a string. 

Eg. 'hellomyfriend291'.isalpha() would display False because the string contains both letters and numbers while it's only checking for letters NOT numbers.
But it would display True for 'hellomyfriend291'.isalnum()

.startwith() & .endwith() will check if the string starts or ends with the argument. 

We can also use 'string'.join(['other strings']) to insert the value of the string into other strings.

Eg. ' '.join(['cats', 'rats', 'bats'])
Displays  'cats rats bats'

You can use the split() function to split a string into a bunch of smaller strings.
Eg. 'my name is Simpleton'.split()
Displays  ['my', 'name', 'is', 'Simpleton']

.rjust(), .ljust() & .center() places the agrument on the left, right or around the string alongside the quality. 
Eg. 'Hello'.center(20, 'T')
Displays  'TPHelloT'

Lastly, .strip(), .lstrip() & .rstrip() will remove the agrument from the string depending on how and which one you use. 
Eg. 'SpamSpamSpamBaconEggSpam'.strip('ampS')
Displays  'BaconEgg'
